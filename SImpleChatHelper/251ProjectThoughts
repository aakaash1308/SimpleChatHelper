Security Stuff

	New Nodes can be added using a known ip address and an id associated to it, already in the network.
		This protects from attackers who connect to the LAN using some form of social engineering. 
		They are not able to add themselves as nodes and pollute the network.

	All communication between a server and the client are encrypted.
		We are using a public-private key encryption system, to encrypt communication and files why they are sent
		This allows any non authenticated user to not be able to make requests to any of the nodes
		Also this allows attackers who are reading the data in the network to not be able to make sense dude to encryption
